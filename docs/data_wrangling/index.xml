      <description>10% of your grade will be determined by your level of engagement. Engagement will include participating in class discussions, small group projects, providing quality peer review of code, and being involved in discussions on Canvas. At the end of the term I will have all students perform a peer assessment of their small group members. This assessment will rate each member in several areas regarding:
 Reviewing and providing constructive feedback regarding your code Engaging in quality discussions with the group to improve code knowledge Working well as a team member in the small group activities etc.</description>

      <description>Welcome to week 1! Although we will not meet in class until the end of this week (Monday, October 18th), I do not want to waste time in getting started. We only have 7 weeks together (ðŸ˜¢) so I want to pack each week as full as possible. I am assuming you have fully read the syllabus by now but if not please do so that you understand how this class is structured and what is expected of you.</description>
