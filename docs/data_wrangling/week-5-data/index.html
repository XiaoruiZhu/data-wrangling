      <p>The following provides a short description of the variables in each data sets provided for week 5&rsquo;s homework:</p>
<p><strong>Bomber data sets:</strong> These data provide the following information regarding the United States Air Force bomber aircraft:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type: Represents the type of aircraft. In this case, all aircraft in these data sets are United States Air Force <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_bomber_aircraft">bomber aircraft</a>.</li>
<li>MD: Represents the &ldquo;Mission Design.&rdquo; The letter represents the basic mission of the aircraft (B for bomber) and the number represents the design number.  So all aircraft with a B are bombers but a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_B-1_Lancer">B-1</a> is different than a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_B-2_Spirit">B-2</a> which is different than a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-52_Stratofortress">B-52</a>.</li>
<li>FY: Fiscal year. The data available ranges from fiscal year 1996-2014.</li>
<li>Cost: Represents the total operational cost for flying, maintaining, repairing, and managing the aircraft.</li>
<li>FH: Represents the flying hours, which is the total time the aircraft is in the air flying a mission or in training.</li>
<li>Gallons: Represents the total gallons of fuel burned by the aircraft.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ws_programmatics:</strong> This data provides weapon system programmatics information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base: Represents the Air Force installation. Provides the name of the installation followed by the state the base is located in.</li>
<li>MD: Represents the &ldquo;Mission Design.&rdquo; The letter represents the basic mission of the weapon system (A for attack, C for cargo, B for bomber, F for fighter, etc) and the number represents the design number.</li>
<li>Manpower_Ops: Represents cost of pilots and operators required to operate the weapon system</li>
<li>Manpower_Mx: Represents cost of maintenance personnel required to maintain the weapon system</li>
<li>Manpower_Support_Staff: Represents cost of support staff required to support the weapon system</li>
<li>Operating_Material: Represents cost of operating material such as fuel, oil, etc. required to run the weapon system</li>
<li>Mx_Consumables: Represents cost of small consumable parts (nuts, bolts, wire, etc.) required to maintain the weapon system</li>
<li>Mx_DLR: Represents cost of large parts (engine fans, aircraft seats, etc.) required to maintain the weapon system</li>
<li>Mx_Depot: Represents cost of sending the weapon system to the depot for a large scale maintenance check.</li>
<li>CLS: Represents cost of contractor logistics support services</li>
<li>Total_O.S: Represents the total operational cost for flying, maintaining, repairing, and managing the aircraft (summation of all previously outlined cost elements).</li>
<li>Avg_Inv: Represents total number of weapon systems at the specified location</li>
<li>TAI: Represents total authorized weapon systems at the specified location</li>
<li>End_Strength: Represents total personnel (head count) operating and supporting the weapon system at the specified location</li>
<li>FH: Represents the flying hours, which is the total time the aircraft is in the air flying a mission or in training.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ws_categorization:</strong> This data provides the system categorization for each aircraft:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base: Represents the Air Force installation. Provides the name of the installation followed by the state the base is located in.</li>
<li>System: Represents the system classification of the weapon system. The major classifications for the different weapon systems includes <em>aircraft, missiles, munitions, space systems, ground control,</em> and <em>other</em>.</li>
<li>MD: Represents the &ldquo;Mission Design.&rdquo; The letter represents the basic mission of the weapon system (A for attack, C for cargo, B for bomber, F for fighter, etc) and the number represents the design number.</li>
</ul>
