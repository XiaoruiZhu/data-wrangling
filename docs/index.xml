 It will provide you with more experience using data wrangling tools on real life data sets. It helps you become a self-directed learner. As a data scientist, a large part of your job is to self-direct your learning and interests to find unique and creative ways to find insights in data.</description>

      <description>10% of your grade will be determined by your level of engagement. Engagement will include participating in class discussions, small group projects, providing quality peer review of code, and being involved in discussions on Canvas. At the end of the term I will have all students perform a peer assessment of their small group members. This assessment will rate each member in several areas regarding:
 Reviewing and providing constructive feedback regarding your code Engaging in quality discussions with the group to improve code knowledge Working well as a team member in the small group activities etc.</description>

Please read the final project page before reading any further.
Throughout the term you will progressively create your final project. Your mid-term project is to submit the work you have completed midway through the course for a progress evaluation, where you have fully completed standards 1.</description>

      <description>Welcome to week 1! Although we will not meet in class until the end of this week (Monday, October 18th), I do not want to waste time in getting started. We only have 7 weeks together (ðŸ˜¢) so I want to pack each week as full as possible. I am assuming you have fully read the syllabus by now but if not please do so that you understand how this class is structured and what is expected of you.</description>
