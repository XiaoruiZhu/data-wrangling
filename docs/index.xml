      <description>Purpose The purpose of this individual/group final project is to put to work the tools and knowledge that you gain throughout this course. This provides you with multiple benefits.
 It will provide you with more experience using data wrangling tools on real life data sets. It helps you become a self-directed learner. As a data scientist, a large part of your job is to self-direct your learning and interests to find unique and creative ways to find insights in data.</description>

      <description>10% of your grade will be determined by your level of engagement. Engagement will include participating in class discussions, small group projects, providing quality peer review of code, and being involved in discussions on Canvas. At the end of the term I will have all students perform a peer assessment of their small group members. This assessment will rate each member in several areas regarding:
 Reviewing and providing constructive feedback regarding your code Engaging in quality discussions with the group to improve code knowledge Working well as a team member in the small group activities etc.</description>

      <description>You may work with your group members on the midterm and final projects if you wish. Once you decide on working solo or as a group, your decision remains for the rest of the course (i.e., you can&amp;rsquo;t decide to work alone or join someone after submitting the midterm. Please read the final project page before reading any further.
Throughout the term you will progressively create your final project. Your mid-term project is to submit the work you have completed midway through the course for a progress evaluation, where you have fully completed standards 1.</description>

      <description>Welcome to week 1! Although we will not meet in class until the end of this week (Monday, October 18th), I do not want to waste time in getting started. We only have 7 weeks together (ðŸ˜¢) so I want to pack each week as full as possible. I am assuming you have fully read the syllabus by now but if not please do so that you understand how this class is structured and what is expected of you.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What we have is a data glut.&amp;quot; - Vernon Vinge
 Data are being generated by everything around us at all times. Every digital process and social media exchange produces it. Systems, sensors and mobile devices transmit it. Countless databases collect it. Data are arriving from multiple sources at an alarming rate and analysts and organizations are seeking ways to leverage these new sources of information. Consequently, analysts need to understand how to get data from these data sources.</description>

      <description>Last week we discussed general guidelines for first interacting with a new data set. This week we want to build on those activities by learning how to clean and tidy our data, and then beginning our journey to creating insights with data through data manipulation.
Specifically, this week you are going to learn:
 How to make your data &amp;ldquo;tidy&amp;rdquo;. How to manipulate data to create insights from data.  Consequently, this week will give you a strong foundation for managing and cleaning your data.</description>

      <description>This week builds onto our data wrangling skills by focusing on transforming and joining data. Common transformation procedures include filtering observations by their values, reordering the rows, selecting variables, creating new variables with functions of existing variables, and collapsing values down to single summary summary statistics (i.e. mean, max, variance).
Furthermore, itâ€™s rare that a data analysis involves only a single table of data. Typically you have many tables of data, and you must combine them to answer the questions that youâ€™re interested in.</description>
