During the class term, you will have free access to Datacamp learning modules provided through the *[DataCamp for the Classroom](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/education)* initiative.  I have selected specific modules that you will need to complete prior to each Saturday class at 1PM.  I will track on-time, late, and missed completions of these modules.  Instructions to access these modules will be emailed at the start of the course term.
