title: Week 1 (October 18)
---

Welcome to week 1! Although we will not meet in class until the end of this week (Monday, October 18<sup>th</sup>), I do not want to waste time in getting started. We only have 7 weeks together (&#x1f622;) so I want to pack each week as full as possible. I am assuming you have fully read the syllabus by now but if not please do so that you understand how this class is structured and what is expected of you.  I will spend the first few minutes of class on Monday re-iterating a few points so that we are all on the same page but I do not want to spend 30-60 minutes doing so, so make sure you read (and re-read) it thoroughly.


Please download this material for Monday's class:


| Title                     | Handouts  |
|:-------------------------:|--------------|
| **Lecture 01-A**          | [**Slides**](01a_slides_BANA7025.pdf) |
| **Lecture 01-B**          | [**Slides**](01b_slides_BANA7025.pdf) |
| **Coding exercises**          | [**pdf**](coding_exercises_1.pdf) |
| **Customer churn data**  | [**Data**](customer_churn_data_cleaning.csv) |
| **Cincy crimes data** | [**Data**](week1_cincy_crimes.csv) |

The focus of this week is two-fold:

1. To get yourself (re-)introduced to R and the RStudio IDE.
2. To introduce you to base R data selection/manipulation/cleaning techniques. 

Below outlines the reading and homework that you complete before next week's class. The skills and functions introduced in these readings will be necessary for Monday's in-class activities. If you have any questions or concerns your first step should be going to our [Canvas Discussions](https://uc.instructure.com/) and posting your issue.  You and your classmates should be monitoring Canvas to help each other out. In addition, I will also be watching them and will chime in when necessary but my hope is that this will be a social process where everyone contributes to knowledge advancement.
