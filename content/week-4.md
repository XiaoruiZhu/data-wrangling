title: Week 4 (Nov 8th)
---

This week builds onto our data wrangling skills by focusing on transforming and joining data. Common transformation procedures include filtering observations by their values, reordering the rows, selecting variables, creating new variables with functions of existing variables, and collapsing values down to single summary summary statistics (i.e. mean, max, variance). 

Furthermore, it’s **rare that a data analysis involves only a single table of data**. Typically you have many tables of data, and you must combine them to answer the questions that you’re interested in. Collectively, multiple tables of data are called _relational_ data because it is the relations, not just the individual datasets, that are important.

Data scientists often work with different data types, and sometimes working with different data types can be difficult.  Thankfully, the Tidyverse has powerful (and easy to use!) packages that make data wrangling with difficult data types much easier.

This module covers these basic capabilities by teaching you how to use the `dplyr` package and other Tidyverse to perform common data transformation and joining tasks.

## Mid-term Project Due!

Be sure to refer to the [grading rubric](mid-term) so you understand what is expected for your mid-term project.  Create an HTML R markdown document titled "Project Proposal" and be sure to include your name in the YAML.
